In another small step toward its competitors, Windows Phone 7 will finally be able to play some of the most popular games on other smartphone platforms.  Not the least of these games is Angry Birds, whose presence on every imaginable platform represented a rather large hole in the Windows Phone 7 game lineup.

The complete list of games to be released over a six-week period starting on April 6th:
<ul>
  <li>Angry Birds</li>
  <li>Doodle Jump</li>
  <li>Plants vs Zombies</li>
  <li>Hydro Thunder Go</li>
  <li>Sonic the Hedgehog 4 Episode I</li>
  <li>geoDefense</li>
</ul>

It's unfortunate that the release dates seem to be arbitrarily delayed, but the real question becomes the price of these apps.  In general, it seems that Xbox LIVE games on Windows Phone 7 seem to command a significantly higher premium than the same games on other platforms.
