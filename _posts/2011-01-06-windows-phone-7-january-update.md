The update has been announced since before the phone even launched, but now the "January Update" has become a bit more official.  Microsoft has posted a site (which used to give a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsphone/en-us/features/january-update.aspx">hint to the release date</a>) listing the three main features of the new update:

<blockquote><strong>Copy and paste</strong>
Soon you’ll be able to copy text from emails, text messages, web pages, and Office Mobile documents, and paste it anywhere you can type.   Using copy and paste is easy and intuitive. In many cases you just tap a word, slide your finger to highlight any additional text, then tap the Copy icon. To insert this text in a message or app, just tap the spot where it should go, then tap the Paste icon.   Copy and paste is a handy way to quickly send someone’s latest Facebook update, turn-by-turn directions from Maps, or a must-see link from Internet Explorer Mobile. Once you’ve copied something, you can paste it again and again.   The new feature adds to the list of time-saving shortcuts already built into Windows Phone, like the ability to tap an address on a webpage to map it (US only).

<strong>Faster apps and games</strong>
Nobody likes to wait. That’s why we’ve whittled down the time it takes for apps and games to start up and resume. It’s all part of our focus on getting you to the things you love, easier and faster.

<strong>Better Marketplace search</strong>
We’ve streamlined Marketplace search to make it easier to find specific apps, games, or music. Press the Search button in the apps or games section of Marketplace and you’ll see only apps or games in the results.  Press Search in the music section of Marketplace to search just the music catalog.</blockquote>
Sure, these are all features that would be nice to have (the Marketplace search has been driving me bonkers, honestly), but what about the other missing features?  No mention of custom ringtones, separate volume controls, or better SkyDrive integration for Office.  There are also a number of looming bugs that desperately need attention, but yet no mention of bug fixes at all.  I sincerely hope that the complete lack of new functionality is eclipsed by the shear number of bug fixes included in this new update.

I certainly hope that they can get the update out by the end of January (or at least early February), but it would be nice to get a more solid release date than:

<blockquote><strong>Getting phone updates</strong>
How will you know when an update is available? Easy. Your phone is designed to automatically tell you via a pop-up message (unless you’ve turned this option off).
